Thanks to Bibendovsky's source port of Blake Stone it is possible to build and install Blake Stone Aliens of Gold and Planet Strike
on Raspberry Pi and RetroPie

This port uses SDL2 dependencies

**Install time:**
It takes about 10 minutes to install

**Notes:**
The source port downloads and can be installed from the Experimental section in RetroPie-Setup but is considered experimental since it might has some bugs. Keyboard typing locks in
Command Line Interface/Terminal. There can be other bugs as well.

**Disclaimer:** This installation script is provided as is. Im not responsible for anything happening with your Raspberry Pi including corruption of SD card, Hardware damage. 
For support and help you can contact me here on RetroPie forums.
